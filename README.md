# model_identification_NLsys
I used the python library pysindy to try to catch the dynamics of an electric motor, starting from input-output data
The libraries needed are in the requirements.txt file, for the training it have been used the step data, you can also change it at rows 15-22 and see how the result changes

IMPORTANT: The program will pause when it shows the charts, therefore to make it continue and show the other plots you need to close the current plot window
